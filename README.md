# Express CRUD with File Storage -- Books API

Write an Express app, that uses a file for persistent storage.

## Expectations

* Use ES6 wherever possible (e.g. `let`, `const`, destructuring and fat arrow functions)
* Use the [GitHub Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* Make regular commits
  * Make a commit every time you complete a feature
  * Give each commit a meaningful commit message
  * Don't expect the directions in this README to tell you when to commit
* All file operations must be asynchronous
* Your code must be perfectly indented.  If we can't read it, we aren't going to grade it.
* Work in your project directory at all times
* All access to the data (both in the file and in memory) can only be done through your `data_store` module
  * This stresses the [Single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)

## Part 1: Set up your npm/Express project

1. Fork and clone this repo
1. `touch app.js`
1. `npm init -y`
1. `npm install --save express`
1. `echo node_modules > .gitignore`
1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m "Initial project setup"`

## Part 2: Set up nodemon and your npm scripts

1. `npm install --save-dev nodemon`
1. Open `package.json`
1. Inside `scripts`
  * add ``"watch": "`npm bin`/nodemon"``
  * make sure that you have the trailing commas in the right places!
1. `npm run watch`
1. Leave nodemon running.  Open up a new terminal window/tab, and continue working from this new terminal.

## Part 3: Create an Express server

1. Open `app.js`
1. Require Express
1. Initialize an `app`
1. Determine the port to use
  * The port to use could be passed in as the second command line argument
  * If not provided, default to 8000
  * Store the port in a `const`
1. Use `app.listen` to bind and listen for connections on the above port
1. Check that there are no errors in the terminal where nodemon is running
1. Go to `http://localhost:8000`.  If everything is working, you should see `Cannot GET /`
1. Git add, commit, push

## Part 4: Set up your database file

1. `mkdir db`
  * `db` is short for "database"
1. `cd db`
1. `touch seed.json`
  * this is where our initial data (i.e. "seed data") is stored
  * this file will be used to reset our database file whenever we want to start over
1. open `seed.json` and paste the following inside

    ```js
    [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "author": "Marijn Haverbeke",
        "title": "Eloquent JavaScript"
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "author": "Nick Morgan",
        "title": "JavaScript for Kids"
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "author": "Kyle Simpson",
        "title": "You Don't Know JS"
      }
    ]
    ```

1. Go back to your project directory
1. Open `package.json`
1. Inside `scripts`
  * add `"reset": "cp db/seed.json db/data.json"`
  * make sure that you have the trailing commas in the right places!
1. `npm run reset`
1. `ls db`
  * notice that there is now a `data.json` in the `db` directory
  * `db/data.json` is the file that we are going to modify
  * if you make changes to `db/data.json` that you don't like and you want to start again,
    `npm run reset` will reset `db/data.json` to be the same as `db/seed.json`
1. `echo db/data.json >> .gitignore`
  * database files are typically not checked into source control, because they
    can get large, have nothing to do with development, and might hold sensitive
    data

## Part 5: Create a module called data_store

1. Create a new file called `data_store.js`
1. Open `data_store.js`
1. Create an empty module in here.  We will fill it in in the following steps.
1. Open `app.js`
1. Require your data_store module

## Part 6: Implement a function that reads the contents of the file into memory

1. Open `data_store.js`
1. Create a global variable, called `global_store`.  Set it to `null`
1. Do NOT export this global variable
  * *Why not?* Single responsibility principle.  Only the `data_store` should handle all access to/from the data.
1. Write a function called `load_from_file` that reads all the contents of the `db/data.json` file into memory
  * *TIP:* "into memory" means save it in a variable (let's use the above-created global variable)
  * File read/write is slow.  So we will work from memory as much as
    possible and only update the file when we have to.
1. Export this function.
1. Open `app.js`
1. Call `load_from_file` before you call `app.listen`

## Part 7: Implement a function that returns all the books

1. Open `data_store.js`
1. Write a function called `get_all_books` that returns an array of all the books that are in memory
1. Export this function.

## Part 8: Implement GET /api/books

1. Define a GET route at /api/books
1. The route should send a json response with an array of all the books
  * use your data store's `get_all_books` function to achieve this
1. If your data store is `null` (and so `get_all_books` returns null), respond with 404 Not Found

## Part 9: Implement finding a book by its ID

1. Open `data_store.js`
1. Write a function called `get_book_by_id(id)`
  * returns the book with that ID
  * if no book is found, return `undefined`
1. Export this function.

## Part 10: Implement GET /api/books/:id

1. Define a GET route at /api/books/:id
1. The route should send a json response with the book that has the given ID
  * use your data store's `get_book_by_id(id)` function to achieve this
1. If there is no book with the given ID, respond with `404 Not Found`

## Part 11: Implement a function that updates the file with the current information

1. Open `data_store.js`
1. Write a function called `write_to_file` that writes all the books that are in memory, back into the file
  * if there is an error, throw it (i.e. `throw err`)
  * if it is successful, log a success message to the console
1. Make sure that you can read the data back out of the file by using `load_from_file`
1. Do NOT export this function.
  * This function is going to be a "private" or "secret" function that only your module can use
  * The management of the data store should be invisible to all outside libraries that use the module
  * So we restrict access to only the functions that outside libraries need to do their tasks,
    by only exporting functions and variables that we think they need to use

## Part 12: Implement adding a new book (with a unique id) to the data store

1. Open `data_store.js`
1. Create a new global variable called `last_id`
1. When you call `load_from_file`, update `last_id` to be the largest ID that was loaded from the file
1. Write a function called `add_book` that:
  * takes an object as a parameter
  * gives it a unique ID
    * *TIP:* just add 1 to `last_id` and use that
  * adds it to the books that are already in memory
  * calls `write_to_file` to update the file
  * returns the added book (with its unique ID)
1. Export this function

## Part 13: Implement POST /api/books

1. Install and use `body-parser`
1. Get the body of the request and pass it to `add_book`
1. The route should send a json response with the newly-created book
1. The status of the request should be `201 Created`
1. Check `db/data.json` to be sure that your new book is in there with a unique ID

## Part 14: Implement updating a book in the data store

1. Open `data_store.js`
1. Write a function called `update_book` that:
  * takes an ID as a parameter
  * takes an object as a parameter
  * finds the book with that ID
  * if it is not found, return `undefined`
  * updates that book to have the information in the object
  * do NOT update the ID
  * calls `write_to_file` to update the file
  * returns the updated book
1. Export this function

## Part 15: Implement PUT /api/books/:id

1. Get the body of the request and pass it to `update_book`
1. The route should send a json response with the newly-updated book
1. If there is no book with the given ID, respond with `404 Not Found`
1. Check `db/data.json` to be sure that your book was updated in the file as expected

## Part 16: Implement deleting a book from the data store

1. Open `data_store.js`
1. Write a function called `delete_book` that:
  * takes an ID as a parameter
  * finds the book with that ID
  * if it is not found, return `undefined`
  * removes that book from the global variable
  * calls `write_to_file` to update the file
  * returns the removed book
1. Export this function

## Part 17: Implement DELETE /api/books/:id

1. Define a DELETE route at /api/books/:id
1. The route should send a json response with the book that was deleted
  * use your data store's `delete_book` function to achieve this
1. If there is no book with the given ID, respond with `404 Not Found`
1. Check `db/data.json` to be sure that target book gone from the file

## STRETCH

### Improve the performance of your data store

#### Implement the data store using a Map

1. Use a [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map),
  instead of an array, to store the books
1. In `load_from_file`, iterate over the JSON array that you get from the data-file
  * Load each book into the Map using its ID as a key
1. Change `get_books` to return an array that is populated from the Map
1. Change `get_book_by_id(id)` to use the Map's way of looking up an item by its key
1. Likewise modify `add_book`, `update_book`, `delete_book`

#### Why?

Right now the store is an array.
To find something in our array, we are checking every element's ID until we find the one that we want.
If we use a Map or an object, and we load each item into it with a key (in our case, use its ID),
we can instead look up each book much more quickly by its key (i.e. its ID).
It then becomes trivial and fast to see if it exists, to find it, to update it, and to delete it.

### Improve the error-checking of your data store

#### Implement a safety-wrapper around the data store

1. Implement a function called `get_store` that:
  * Checks that the data store is not null
  * If it is null, throw an exception
  * If it is not null, return the data store
1. Everywhere in your code that uses or returns the data store, should use this function instead
  * *NOTE:* This excludes when you ASSIGN the data store in `load_from_file`,
    because here we need to SET the data store as opposed to ACCESSING it

#### Why?

Right now, whenever we look up an item in the data store, we are assuming that
the data store is available and was loaded successfully.
However, this might not always be the case!  What if there was an error when loading it?
What if the data store is not available?  (e.g. the memory or database or server is unavailable)
